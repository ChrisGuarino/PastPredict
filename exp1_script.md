# Deep Learning for Time-Series Forecasting

## Slide 1: Introduction
- **Welcome** to our study of using deep learning for time-series prediction, focusing on forward versus backward data coorelations.
- **Today's focus**: We will explore several neural network models including RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and Transformers.
- **Data source**: We use historical stock price data from Apple Inc. (AAPL) as our example.

## Slide 2: Data Preparation
- **Data retrieval**: AAPL stock data is fetched via Yahoo Finance using `pandas_datareader` and `yfinance`.
- **Preprocessing steps**:
  - Two distinct datasets are established, a forward flowing and a backward flowing. 
  - Features are standardized using `MinMaxScaler` to enhance model performance.
  - Data is split into training and testing sets to effectively evaluate our models.

## Slide 3: Building Time-Series Sequences
- **Sequence Transformation**: To prepare our data for the sequential nature of our models, we transform our dataset into sequences.
- **Purpose**: These sequences are used to predict stock prices based on previously seen data points.
- **Advantage**: This method enhances our model's ability to capture temporal patterns and dependencies.

## Slide 4: Simple RNN Model
- **Architecture**: Introduction to the architecture of a simple RNN:
  - Includes an input layer, a recurrent layer, and a fully connected layer that outputs the prediction.
- **Training**: We train this model using backpropagation through time and optimize with the Adam optimizer.
- **Loss Metric**: Loss is calculated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure the prediction accuracy.

## Slide 5: LSTM and GRU Models
- **Model Explanation**:
  - LSTM and GRU architectures are designed to better capture long-term dependencies compared to standard RNNs.
  - GRUs are simpler and potentially faster to train than LSTMs with similar performance benefits.
- **Training Conditions**: Each model is trained under the same conditions for a fair comparison.

## Slide 6: Transformer Model
- **Model Introduction**: We introduce a Transformer model adapted for time-series:
  - Utilizes positional encodings and self-attention mechanisms.
  - Aimed at capturing complex patterns over long time horizons without the need for recurrent architecture.
- **Training Focus**: Training involves adjusting weights to minimize the MSE loss, aiming for low test errors indicative of good generalization.

## Slide 7: Training Process and Results
- **Training Details**: Detailed look at the training process:
  - Monitoring of training and validation losses to understand model convergence.
  - Graphs demonstrate the MSE loss trends across epochs for each model.
- **Results Analysis**: Comparative analysis highlights the effectiveness of each model in predicting stock prices.

## Slide 8: Conclusion
- **Key Findings Summary**:
  - Effectiveness of each model type and configurations.
  - Insights into bidirectional training and its impact on performance.
- **Future Steps**: Discussion on potential improvements and future steps for deeper analysis.

## Slide 9: Q&A
- **Interactive Session**: Open the floor for any questions from the audience to clarify doubts or expand on specific points discussed.
